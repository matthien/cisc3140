1. my-script.sh
	- First line of code prints out string "number of reviews that gave 5 star ratings: " 
	- Second line of code goes to the 6th column of ramen-ratings.csv and counts how many cells have '5.' After counting, it would print that amount.

2. gif.sh
	- I utilzied ImageMagick to create a gif. There three images in the images folder and I played them consecutively with a 1 second delay. It would loop infinitely because of "-loop 0." The output file would be called "animation.gif."
